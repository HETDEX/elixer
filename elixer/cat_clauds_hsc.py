Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CHFT) Large Area U-bands Deep Survey (CLAUDS) and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)


If using in publication, include:
“These data were obtained and processed as part of the CFHT Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS),
which is a collaboration between astronomers from Canada, France, and China described in Sawicki et al. (2019, [MNRAS 489, 5202]).
CLAUDS data products can be accessed from https://www.clauds.net. CLAUDS is based on observations obtained with
MegaPrime/ MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the CFHT which is operated by the
National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l’Univers of the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. CLAUDS uses data obtained in part through the
Telescope Access Program (TAP), which has been funded by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
and the Special Fund for Astronomy from the Ministry of Finance of China. CLAUDS uses data products from TERAPIX and
the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) and was carried out using resources from Compute Canada and
Canadian Advanced Network For Astrophysical Research (CANFAR).”
