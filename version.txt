changes to voltron by version

1.4.0a3
* change reported flux for bid catalog objects to magnitude for easier comparison
    (note: in some catalogs, the mag is provided by the catalog, in some it is calculated from the flux)
    uses v,g,r bands (in that order, when present)

* add global option DYNAMIC_MAG_APERTURE that, when true, allows the forced aperture placed on the imaging to calculate
    the magnitude to grow until the magnitude stabalizes or reaches the maximum of the error window. Currently set
    to a minium of 0.5". Stablization defined by either an increase in magnitude (dimming) or a change of less than
    0.1 mag. The aperture is sized to match on the cutout and the radius is reported next to the magnitude beneath the
    plot.

* update contrast stretching for summed 2D cutout for better readability

* update summing of spectra (upper right) to use RSP1 output when present

* update summed spectra plotting (upper right and full spectra, center) to standard plot (from step plotting)
