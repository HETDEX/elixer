changes to voltron by version

1.4.0a4 [2018-06-07]
* fit sigmoid and variable degree polynomial (default=3 and better fit) to probability of random alignment
  by magnitude matrix (may want to get more data and more refined bins)

* updated peakfinder (boxcar smoothing w/3x pixels to reduce jitter, boost S/N) then fit with gaussian
  to the original spectra at peak points
    - additional lines (a few NaI, NeV, NeVI)

* reworked multi-line solution finder
  - solution accepted if it dominates the score of all solutions with 2+ additional lines detetect of significant quality
        (obs_EW, total flux, etc)
  - added large emission line name and colored highlights to full 1D spectrum plot if a strong multiline solution is found
  - added name, rest wavelength, z, and EW to last line of stats text (upper left)
  (still tbd include this information in a text catalog)

* added hatch marks to skylines to disambiguate from possible emission line highlights

* fixed problem with HSC tract catalogs (entries in tracts corresponding to overlapping tiles do not correctly
  overlap (objects that appear in the overlap region are not necessarily recorded in the overlapping tracts).
  Now keeps all overlapping tracts, not just the one corresponding to the selected image tile.

* allow pdf to still be produced even if rsp1 (*2d.res file) is empty (or all zeroes). Data may be junk, but
  the pdf will still be produced.

* for classification scoring, feed in fluxes as e-18 (rather than e-17) ... the scaling is then very close to
  counts and the downstream logic can remain unchanged




1.4.0a3 [2018-05-25]
* add cat_bayesian package to handle Bayesian treatment of bid catalog objects (priors on likelihood of match to
    observation)
    - initial version of likelihood of being not random (as MDF based on Yaswant's work)
    - sorting possible matches by this prob then distance
    - added to top 3 bid match summaries

* change reported flux for bid catalog objects to magnitude for easier comparison
    (note: in some catalogs, the mag is provided by the catalog, in some it is calculated from the flux)
    uses v,g,r bands (in that order, when present)

* add global option DYNAMIC_MAG_APERTURE that, when true, allows the forced aperture placed on the imaging to calculate
    the magnitude to grow until the magnitude stabilizes or reaches the maximum of the error window. Currently set
    to a minimum of 0.5". Stabilization defined by either an increase in magnitude (dimming) or a change of less than
    0.05 mag. The aperture is sized to match on the cutout and the radius is reported next to the magnitude beneath the
    plot.

* update summing of spectra (upper right) to use RSP1 output when present

* update summed spectra plotting (upper right and full spectra, center) to standard plot (from step plotting)

* fixed(?) stackedCOSMOS and SHELA magnitude calcuations. Imaging counts are already in nJy and do not need to be
    converted.

* update contrast stretching for summed 2D cutout for better readability

* update SHELA and COSMOS aperture magnitude calculations (pixels are already in nJy and do not need conversion)
   (there is still some mismatch between reported mag and aperture mag, but it is closer)

* fixed missing S/N in upper left stats

* remove chi2 if not present (upper left stats)

* (temporarily?) turned off quality score until it can be re-scaled to flux (from counts)

* removed dead code from catalog classes (older versions that optionally produced individual pages for each bid catalog
    match, etc)
