changes to voltron by version

1.4.0a3 [2018-05-23]
* change reported flux for bid catalog objects to magnitude for easier comparison
    (note: in some catalogs, the mag is provided by the catalog, in some it is calculated from the flux)
    uses v,g,r bands (in that order, when present)

* add global option DYNAMIC_MAG_APERTURE that, when true, allows the forced aperture placed on the imaging to calculate
    the magnitude to grow until the magnitude stabalizes or reaches the maximum of the error window. Currently set
    to a minium of 0.5". Stablization defined by either an increase in magnitude (dimming) or a change of less than
    0.1 mag. The aperture is sized to match on the cutout and the radius is reported next to the magnitude beneath the
    plot.

* update contrast stretching for summed 2D cutout for better readability

* update summing of spectra (upper right) to use RSP1 output when present

* update summed spectra plotting (upper right and full spectra, center) to standard plot (from step plotting)

* fixed(?) stackedCOSMOS and SHELA magnitude calcuations. Imaging counts are already in nJy and do not need to be
    converted.

* removed dead code from catalog classes (older versions that optionally produced individual pages for each bid catalog
    match, etc)

* add cat_bayesian package to handle Bayesian treatment of bid catalog objects (priors on likelihood of match to
    observation)
    - initial version of likelihood of being not random (as MDF based on Yaswant's work)
    - sorting possible matches by this prob then distance
    - added to top 3 bid match summaries

* update SHELA and COSMOS magnitude calculations (pixels are already in nJy and do not need conversion)
   (there is still some mismatch between reported mag and aperture mag, but it is closer)

* fixed missing S/N in upper left stats

* remove chi2 if not present (upper left stats)

* (temporarily?) turned off quality score until it can be re-scaled to flux (from counts)
