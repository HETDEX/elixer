* add version number to top of first page

* if no imaging catalog, default to dummy catalog that produces the relative fiber posistions plot

* make master_cutout larger than initially needed (crop down to display to needed extent),
so can use as base if fiber positions are too spread out

* add ground-based imaging catalog (see http://terapix.iap.fr/article.php?id_article=586 )

* name: HIVES (Hetdex Image matching and Visualization of Emission Sources)

* add option in svoltron.py for:
     email notifications
